## Product Requirements Document: ERPNext Modern UI (ClickUp Inspired)

### 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a new custom theme for ERPNext, designed to modernize its user interface (UI) and user experience (UX). The new theme will be delivered as a custom Frappe application, ensuring it is easy to install, maintain, and update without modifying the core ERPNext codebase. The primary design inspiration for this project is the UI of **ClickUp**, a project management tool known for its clean, modern, and intuitive interface.

### 2. Vision and Goal

Our vision is to transform the ERPNext user experience from a traditional, data-heavy interface into a modern, visually appealing, and intuitive workspace. We want to make ERPNext not only powerful but also enjoyable to use.

The primary goal of this project is to **increase user adoption and satisfaction** by providing a UI that is:

*   **Modern and Aesthetically Pleasing:** Replace the dated look and feel with a fresh, clean design.
*   **Intuitive and User-Friendly:** Improve navigation and information hierarchy to reduce the learning curve for new users.
*   **Non-disruptive:** Enhance the UI without altering the core functionality or workflows that users rely on.

### 3. Problem Statement

The default ERPNext UI, while functional, is often perceived as:

*   **Outdated:** The design does not align with modern web application standards, which can make it feel clunky and unintuitive.
*   **Overwhelming for New Users:** The dense information layout and traditional ERP design can be intimidating for users unfamiliar with such systems.
*   **Lacking in Visual Polish:** The aesthetics do not inspire user engagement, which can impact overall productivity and satisfaction.

This project aims to solve these problems by delivering a beautiful, modern, and easy-to-navigate UI theme inspired by ClickUp.

### 4. Scope and Features

This project is focused exclusively on the UI/UX of the ERPNext Desk. Core backend functionality will not be changed.

#### In Scope:

*   **New Color Palette:** Implement a modern and clean color scheme inspired by ClickUp, with a focus on blues, grays, and whites for a professional look.
*   **Modern Typography:** Update the default fonts to a more modern and readable alternative, such as Inter or a similar sans-serif font.
*   **Redesigned Navigation:**
    *   **Sidebar:** Overhaul the main sidebar to be cleaner, with better-organized modules and icons.
    *   **Header:** Redesign the header for a more streamlined look.
*   **Updated Form and List Views:**
    *   **Forms:** Redesign form layouts to be cleaner, with better spacing and more modern input fields, buttons, and other controls.
    *   **Lists:** Improve the list view with better row spacing, clearer action buttons, and a more modern aesthetic.
*   **Dashboard Enhancements:** Restyle the dashboard widgets for a more modern and visually engaging look.
*   **Custom App Delivery:** All changes will be packaged into a single, installable custom Frappe app.

#### Out of Scope:

*   **Changes to Core Functionality:** We will not alter any of the business logic or workflows of ERPNext.
*   **Website Theme:** This project will not affect the public-facing website theme.
*   **New Features:** We will not be adding any new features to ERPNext (e.g., a new type of report or a new module).
*   **Mobile App UI:** The scope is limited to the web-based Desk UI.

### 5. Design and UX Requirements

*   **Inspiration:** The primary design reference is **ClickUp**. We should aim to capture its clean, spacious, and intuitive feel.
*   **Colors:** The theme will use a primary color (e.g., a modern blue) for actions and navigation, with a neutral palette (light grays and whites) for the background and other elements.
*   **Spacing:** Increase whitespace and padding to reduce visual clutter and improve readability.
*   **Icons:** Utilize a consistent and modern icon set, possibly from a library like Feather Icons or a similar alternative.
*   **Responsiveness:** The new theme must be fully responsive and work seamlessly on all major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) and screen sizes.

### 6. Technical Requirements

*   **Custom Frappe App:** The theme will be developed as a standalone custom app to ensure it doesn't interfere with core ERPNext updates.
*   **CSS Overrides:** The primary method for styling will be through custom CSS that overrides the default Frappe/ERPNext styles.
*   **JavaScript for Dynamic Changes:** If needed, JavaScript will be used for minor DOM manipulations or to enhance UI interactions.
*   **Hooks:** The app will use `hooks.py` to inject the necessary CSS and JavaScript files into the ERPNext Desk.

### 7. Success Metrics

The success of this project will be measured by:

*   **User Feedback:** Positive feedback from users on the new design. This can be collected through surveys or informal feedback channels.
*   **Adoption Rate:** The number of users who choose to use the new theme (if it's made optional alongside the default).
*   **Reduced Training Time:** Anecdotal evidence from team leads or trainers that new users are finding the system easier to navigate.
